## ProPlates ![VRCUK](https://img.shields.io/badge/VRChatUtilityKit-required-orange?style=flat-square)

ProPlates displays a player's pronouns under their nameplate.

ProPlates will attempt to look for pronouns formatted as `xxx/xxx` or `xxx\xxx` (infinite) anywhere in your bio and status text.

> **NOTE:** This mod also has some basic safeguards against trolls because even in the current year, people still think attack helicopter jokes are funny for whatever reason.

Safeguards include:

- Default display limit of 3 pronouns
- Duplicate checking
- Pronoun filtering (`pronouns.json` contains the [most common good faith pronouns](https://github.com/witch-house/pronoun.is/blob/master/resources/pronouns.tab). If you feel that more pronouns belong here, feel free to send a pull request!)
